# Interactive Multiplication Table

This interactive multiplication table is a learning tool to help complement student's learning on multiplication.

Learners should see how multiplication applies to physical objects, and to use that as a complement to memorizing the multiplication table.

If a student knows what 3x2 is, can they understand 3x3 on a fundamental level? What does it mean to increase the multiplier? A learner should be able to see that it is simply adding another group of the same amount.
